NinjaStars are here to provide step-by-step (ooh baby) guides that demonstrate integrations, and stages of the cybersecurity attack chain. The goal is to provide engineers with a bag of tools to demonstrate various parts of the Snyk platform.

We intend to provide quick to build and immutable infrastructure so that you can quickly execute tests in a closed environment, without spending so much time doing system engineering.

Each post must be labelled with at least 2 Labels, ninjastars and 1 other. Labels map each post to individual solutions. This way you can easily find a bunch of ninja stars that are relevant to what you are trying to do.
