NinjaStars are here to provide step-by-step (ooh baby) guides that demonstrate integrations, and stages of the cybersecurity attack chain. The goal is to provide engineers with a bag of tools to demonstrate various parts of the Snyk platform.

We intend to provide quick to build and immutable infrastructure so that you can quickly execute tests in a closed environment, without spending so much time doing system engineering.

Each post must be labelled with at least 2 Labels, ninjastars and 1 other. Labels map each post to individual solutions. This way you can easily find a bunch of ninja stars that are relevant to what you are trying to do.

This is the base Jekyll theme. You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)
